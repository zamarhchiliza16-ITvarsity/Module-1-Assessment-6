    <h1>AIR-FRESHENER</h1>
        <img src="images/airfreshener.jpg" height="400">
        <p>Air freshener is a substance or device for making the air in a room/car smell fresh. It is designed to mask or remove unpleasant room odors. These products typically deliver fragrance and other odor counteractants into the air. They do so through a variety of product formats, including aerosols, candles, potpourri, and gelsHigh-tech versions are heat activated or can automatically spray into the air throughout the day. Even the names of the fragrances have been revamped. Traditional scents such as "rose" or "lemon" have been replaced with more exotic sounding names such as "Tahitian spring mist" or "dewy citrus orchard.". Most air fresheners contain a variety of fragrances and essential oils. Fragrances are chemical compounds that have pleasant odors. Essential oils are naturally occurring oils typically obtained from plants. The oil contains the essence of the plant’s fragrance, hence the term "essential". Examples of essential oils include cinnamon oil, pine oil, and lavender oil.</p>
