Ten minutes of foot massage daily helps in transporting oxygen to the body’s cells, which is essential for overall health.</li>
            <li><b>Helps in relaxation:</b>
           After a tiring and stressful day, a foot massage is a soothing and relaxing way to relax, particularly after a long day of standing and walking around, as the feet tend to swell up. Massage and reflexology of 5 to 10 minutes before going to bed can improve feelings of general well-being.</li>
            <li><b>Promotes better sleep:</b>
           The best time to do foot massage is before going to bed. A soothing and relaxing foot massage improves the blood circulation. This helps in getting a peaceful sleep.</li>
