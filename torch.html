    <h1>TORCH</h1>
        <img src="images/torch2.jpg" height="400">
        <p>A torch is a portable hand-held electric light. The source of the light often used to be an incandescent light bulb (lamp) but has been gradually replaced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) since the mid-2000s.Torches have evolved ove the years. From torches that had fire burning on top of a stick to electrical torches that used batteries. After some years torches that are charged when their power is done were invented and now there are torches that also work as power banks. With the loadshedding crisis our country is facing torches are now a necessity.</p>

            <li><b>In an Emergency the Right Tool is Everything:</b>When responding to an emergency your equipment has to work the first time and every time. Never is this more critical than in low-light situations. You can’t risk missing something in the shadows and you can’t lose precious time looking for another light or batteries. Choose a flashlight that is waterproof and USB rechargeable if possible. In addition, a flashlight that also has a strobe feature is ideal in emergency response situations for marking locations or alerting others to danger.</li>
            <li><b>The Right Tool for the Job:</b>The right tool just doesn’t make your job easier, it improves your performance. This is true for flashlights as well. Think about all the ways you use your light. You need to be able to clip your light inside of your bunker pants, tactical gear, or utility belt and have it ready when you need it without looking for it. You also need your light to fit into your work pockets and have the ability to carry a smaller back-up or additional light for when your job calls for multiple flashlights. It is also important for your light to have a variety of illumination modes to adjust to the different situations you face every day on the job. Lastly, like you, your light has to be indestructible and work in the most demand situations.</li>
            <li><b>Security – Illuminate the Darkness:</b>There is no need to fear the darkness. The right flashlight will give you peace of mind and real security. For your personal security think about a light that can easily fit into a pocket or be attached to a key chain. If you keep your security flashlight in a purse, a clip is a nice feature so you can find it fast when you need it. You want a flashlight that has the sufficient beam length to illuminate the darkness well ahead of you to give you ample time to respond to possible danger.</li>
            <li><b>Outdoor Adventure:</b>When adventuring far from the beaten path the most important features for a flashlight are durability and reliability. The last thing you want is for your light to break after you accidentally drop it on a boulder. You also need it to work without fail when you have to stop and fix a crampon on a glacier in the middle of the night in a snowstorm. Because of the inherent danger and possibility of bodily harm when things going wrong on the trail, make sure your light is bomb-proof. Also make sure your light is fully waterproof to survive and remain functional on those soggy trips or when accidentally dropped into your water source.</li>
